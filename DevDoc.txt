3D Tower Defense Game
======================

- Perlin Noise Generated Terrain Map

- Within generated Terrain Map find suitable places for Main Base Complex that needs to be defended.
- Randomly choose a spot from these found places and place the complex

- Attackers can attack from any angle from the Main Base Complex, They will spawn in and run to attack the Base from the max distance 
  across the map.  The map is continuous from all directions, the Perlin Noise will create a continuous circular terrain that will appear
  wrapped.
  
- A path follow will need to be figured out they will follow around the terrain to attack the main complex

- If they are attacked and terrain allows maybe have them attack the defense turrets

- How to earn coin to make defenses
	- Time
    - Attacker killed
    - Wave rewards

-  main complex (attackers target)
	- has hitpoints
	- can be upgraded between scenes (groups of attacker waves)
    
- Turrets
 	- maybe some towers reduce health as they attack when health out tower is destroyed
 	
	- simple gun tower (low damage, moderate range, fast shots)
	- tesla tower (high damage, low range, slow shots)
	- missle tower (moderate damage, long range, moderate shots)
	- flame thrower tower (moderate damage, low range, continuous damage)
		- trains attack on single target until out of range or dead
	- outposts (moderate damage, moderate range, moderate attack rate)
		- military units are made and deployed form these structures to intercept incoming attackers and block their progress
	- traps (low-high damage, low range, singl use)
		- land mine
			- AOE
			- moderate damage to most, high damage to unarmored
		- spike traps	
			- single target
			- innefective to armored targets
			- high damage
		- emp traps
			- no damage
			- single target
			- disables some targets for long periods of Time
		- gas traps
			- aoe, dot
			- immobilizes unarmored for moderate periods of Time
			- low damage
			
	
	- upgradeable towers
	
	- Basic tower stats
		- attack rate
		- range (radius)
		

- walls
	
- attackers
	- different speeds and types
	- wave bosses
	- complex rushers and defense attackers 
	- ground and air based attacks

	- attacker stats
		- hit points
		- attack rate
		- movement speed
	
- controls
	- WASD(device edges) camera scroll around
	- mouse(screen tap) for panel selections and placement locations

- Scene progression
	- stats
		- number of waves
		- number of attacker spawn points
		- spawn point respawn timer
		- attacker units from spawn point per wave
			- types
			- how many of each types
			- order of realase from spawn point
			- how many released per time increment from respawn timer start

		
- Wave progression
	- each way will add more spawn points and more attackers
	- each way will have a boss at the end that needs to be killed to trigger next wave

	- attackers from a spawn point will find a path to follow and stick to the attack path for the current scenes
		- this will allow the palyer to strategize once they figure out the path
